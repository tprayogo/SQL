#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 
#The order ID is 6 unique numeral number. So, I cleaned up the data to exclude the Null/ invalid order id result. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
